# Matlab-Scripts

The scripts in this repository are written for electroencephalography (EEG) data analysis. 
I have barrowed them from the Affective Neuroscience Laboratory at UWM, improved them and used for my own EEG data processing in the 
Anxiety Disorder Lab at UWM. I don't own the copyright of the scripts.
